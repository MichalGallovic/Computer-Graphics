### Bounce unlimited

3D Platform game Bounce Unlimited ðŸ’¯

Collect points running over red squares. 

Every 5 points enemies level up. 

You only have 3 lives.

If you collide with enemy you loose 1 life.

Currently there is segmentation fault issue in this project and I did not have time to fix it. Though when built on mac without docker it works.
